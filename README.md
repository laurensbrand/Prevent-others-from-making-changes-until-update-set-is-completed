# Prevent-others-from-making-changes-until-update-set-is-completed
This script include when called from a write ACL script will only grant write access if the record is not part of an open update set, other then your own or if the last update was made in the Default update set (which is alwauys open). In an write ACL of for isntance sys_script_include disable the "Admin Overrides" checkbox (mandatory for this whole check to work) and add the following code to the script field of the ACL:   answer = new UpdateSetChecker().checkAllowedWrite(current);  See attached screenshot of what happens if you try to edit an object which is part of an open update set. This whole setup works best if you only start close update sets untill you are finished with all the update sets for a release. Or you put the finished update sets in the status Ignore untill you are ready to transport them to QA/PROD.  If you want you could even create a new status for the update set, like pending or ready. Anything different from the state Complete.
